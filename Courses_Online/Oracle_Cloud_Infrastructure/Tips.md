# OCI Architecture

- **OCI Regions**
	- 21 Available + 15 Planned
	- Commercial, Govt, Microsoft Azure Interconnect
-   **Region** 
	- Localized Geographical area comprised of 1 or more AD
-   **Availability Domains** 
	- One or more fault-tolerent
	- isolated DC located within a region, but connected to each other by low latency,high bandwidth network
	- Do not share physical infrastructure
-   **Fault Domains**
	- Grouping of hardware and infrastructure with in an AD to provide anti-affinity(logical data center)
	- 3 FD per AD
	- Do not share SPOHF
	- change procedures are isolated at FD
-   **One AD Regions**  
	- within one year second AD or region will be made available
-   **Choosing Region**  
	- Location
	- Data Residency & Compliance
	- Service Availability
-   **Avoid SPOF** 
	- Design architecture to deploy instances that perform same tasks in different FD or different AD for multiple AD regions
-   **Data Guard**  
	- Data replication across AD
-   **HA Design**
	- FD, AD, Region Pair
-   **Compartments** 
	- collection of related resources
	- helps to isolate and control access to resources
	- Tenancy/Root compartme
	- Compartment Network, Compartment Storage etc
	- Each resource belong to a single compartment
	- Resource can interact with other resource in diff compartment
	- Resources and compartments can be added/deleted anytim
	- Resources can be moved from one to another
	- Resources from multiple regions can be in the same compartment
	- Compartments can be nested (6 levels deep)
	- Can give group of users access to compartments by writing policies
	- Analyze cost and assign budget for resources in compartments

# OCI Compute Services

	- invoked in response to a CLI command or signed HTTP request Push container to Registry -> Configure Function Trigger -> Code runs only when triggered -> Pay for code execution time only
	- based on FN project

# OCI Storage Services

-   Block Volume, Local NVMe, File Storage, Object Storage, Archive Storage

	- Durability (Copies of data)
	- Connectivity (Local vs network, How does apps access the data)
	- Protocol (Block vs File vs HTTPs)

    - (50 GB — 32 TB, up to 32 volumes/instance (32x32=1PB)
    - Data encrypted at rest and in-transit(oracle managed/customer managed key)  
    - Basic(2 IOPS/GB, 240 KB/s/GB Throughput); throughput intensive workloads with large sequential I/O such as big data & streaming, log processing and data warehouses.  
    - Balanced (60 IOPS/GB, 480 KB/s/GB); most workloads that perform random I/O such as boot disks  
    - High Performance (75 IOPS/GB, 600 KB/s/GB); workload require best possible performance including large DB’s

		- FS — replicates data in 3 FDs
		- can take snapshot and restore snapshot
-   **Object Storage**

	- Each object stored in a bucket, relies on standard HTTP verbs 
	- flat structure
	- OSS — An internet-scale, high performance storage platform
	- ideal for unstructured data
    - regional service
    - storage classes (hot/cold)
    - Use cases: 
	    - content repo for data, images, logs & video etc
	    - Archive/Backup, Storing log data for analysis
	    - Storing large datasets
	    - Big Data/Hadoop storage  
	    - OS replicates in 3 FDs
	    - stores replica of data in more than AD
-   **OS Tiers** 
	- Standard Storage Tier(Hot) Fast, immediate, and frequent access
	- Data retrieval in instances
	- Always serves the most recent copy of the data when retrieved
	- Standard buckets can’t be downgraded to archive storage 
	- Archive Storage Tier (Cold) Seldom or rarely accessed data but must be retained and preserved for long periods of time
	- 10x cheaper than standard tier ($0.0026 vs $0.0255 Gb/month) 
    - 90 days min retention period 
    - objects needs to be restored before download
    - TTFB after restore request is made: 4 hours 
    - Archive bucket can’t be upgraded to Standard
