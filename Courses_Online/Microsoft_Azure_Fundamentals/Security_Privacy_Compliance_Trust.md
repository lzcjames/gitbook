## Securing network connectivity in Azure

### Network Security Group (NSG)

NSGs operate at layers 3 & 4, it allows you to **filter network traffic** to/from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. 
An NSG can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

###  Application Security Groups (ASG)

It enables you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, **allowing you to group** virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.
This feature allows you to **reuse your security policy at scale** without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses.
