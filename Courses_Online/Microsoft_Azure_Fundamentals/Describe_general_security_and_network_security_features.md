## Basic features of Azure Security Center, including policy compliance, security

### What's Azure Security Center?

[Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/2-protect-threats-security-center) is a monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all of your services, both on Azure and on-premises. 

### What's Azure Key Vault ?

[Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/4-manage-secrets-key-vault) is a centralized cloud service for storing an application's secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and logging capabilities.

Azure Key Vault can help you:

-   **Manage secrets**
    
    You can use Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
    
-   **Manage encryption keys**
    
    You can use Key Vault as a key management solution. Key Vault makes it easier to create and control the encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data.
    
-   **Manage SSL/TLS certificates**
    
    Key Vault enables you to provision, manage, and deploy your public and private Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for both your Azure resources and your internal resources.
    
-   **Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)**
    
    These secrets and keys can be protected either by software or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

###  What's Azure Sentinel ?

[Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/3-detect-respond-threats-sentinel) is Microsoft's cloud-based SIEM system. It uses intelligent security analytics and threat analysis.

Azure Sentinel enables you to:

-   **Collect cloud data at scale**
    
    Collect data across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and from multiple clouds.
    
-   **Detect previously undetected threats**
    
    Minimize false positives by using Microsoft's comprehensive analytics and threat intelligence.
    
-   **Investigate threats with artificial intelligence**
    
    Examine suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cybersecurity experience from Microsoft.
    
-   **Respond to incidents rapidly**
    
    Utilize built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.
    
### What's Azure Dedicated Hosts?

[Azure Dedicated Host](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/) provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux.

You're charged per dedicated host, independent of how many virtual machines you deploy to it. The host price is based on the VM family, type (hardware size), and region.
