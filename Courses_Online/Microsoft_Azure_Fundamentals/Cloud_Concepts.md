### High Availability (HA)
The ability of the application to continue running in a healthy state, without significant downtime. By "healthy state," we mean the application is responsive, and users can connect to the application and interact with it.

### Scalability
Increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time. Vertical Scaling (aka "scaling up) - add more resources to existing servers. Horizontal Scaling (aka "scaling out) - add more servers.

### Vertical Scaling (aka "scaling up")
The process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server (e.g. adding a faster CPU, additional CPUs, more memory).

### Horizontal Scaling (aka "scaling out")
The process of adding more servers that function together as one unit (e.g. adding more servers).

### Elasticity
Automatically add or remove resources based on demand.

### Cloud Agility
Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure in order to adapt to the evolving needs of the business (e.g. if your service peaks one month, you can scale to demand and pay a larger bill for the month. If the following month the demand drops, you can reduce the used resources and be charged less).

### Fault Tolerance
Redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This is referred to as fault tolerance and it ensures that your customers aren't impacted when an unexpected accident occurs.

### Disaster Recovery
The ability to recover from rare but major incidents: non-transient, wide-scale failures, such as service disruption that affects an entire region. Disaster recovery includes data backup and archiving, and may include manual intervention, such as restoring a database from backup.

### Economies of Scale
Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale (e.g. the ability to acquire hardware at a lower cost than if a single user or smaller business were purchasing it, cloud providers can also make deals with local governments and utilities to get tax savings, lower pricing on power, cooling, and high-speed network connectivity between sites).

# Compare CapEx vs OpEx

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There is no upfront cost, you pay for a service or product as you use it.
